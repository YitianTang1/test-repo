# part1
This is a project that ask us to build a registration system. 
We have a lot of class data in txt files.
First, we need to open the files for reading.
Then, we need to use the code to read in all data as one long string.
At the same time we have a lot of enrollment data in txt files. 
Same two steps as above. 
Then, we use our code to find the enrollment information for different classes
#part2
Then, we build a quiz system. 
Same steps as above, we need to get the data from quiz txt files.
We will use while loop for the system. Inside the while loop, there are two if and elif statments. Inside the if and elif statements, there are different for loops.
The user could choose to know the quiz or score info. 
If the user choose quiz info, we would tell them how many quizzes there are. And how many questions are in the quiz. 
If the user choose score, we would ask the user to enter the file name. And it would report back the number of students taking the test.Moreover, it would also report the answer key. This system would also tell the user the average score, median score, and lowest and highest score for the quiz. 
#part3
This is a project that has lots of different functions.
